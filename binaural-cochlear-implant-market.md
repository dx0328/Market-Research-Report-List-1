<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Binaural Cochlear Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Body-worn Cochlear Implant</li><li>Ear-worn Cochlear Implant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Binaural Cochlear Implants are divided into two main types: Body-worn Cochlear Implants and Ear-worn Cochlear Implants. Body-worn implants are worn on the body, typically around the waist or chest, and are connected to an external microphone and speech processor. Ear-worn implants are worn directly on the ear and have a smaller, more discreet design. Both types work by converting sound signals into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve, providing improved hearing ability for individuals with hearing loss.</p></p>
