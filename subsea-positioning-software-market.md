<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Positioning Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Long Baseline System</li><li>Short Baseline System</li><li>Ultra Short Baseline System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The subsea positioning software market includes three major types of systems: Long Baseline (LBL), Short Baseline (SBL), and Ultra Short Baseline (USBL) systems. LBL systems use multiple transponders to precisely calculate the position of subsea objects or vehicles. SBL systems use a simpler setup with a single transducer for positioning, suitable for shorter-range applications. USBL systems are designed for even shorter ranges and use a single transducer along with advanced algorithms to provide accurate positioning for small, mobile subsea objects. These systems play a crucial role in underwater exploration, mapping, and navigation.</p></p>
