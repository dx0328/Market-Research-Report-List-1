<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber-optic sensors market can be divided into two types: intrinsic fiber-optic sensors and extrinsic fiber-optic sensors. Intrinsic sensors use the optical fibers themselves as the sensing element, detecting changes in properties like temperature or strain. Extrinsic sensors, on the other hand, use a separate external sensing element that interacts with the fiber. Intrinsic sensors are often preferred for their higher sensitivity and accuracy, while extrinsic sensors are more versatile and can be used in a wider range of applications. Both types play a crucial role in the growing fiber-optic sensor market.</p></p>
