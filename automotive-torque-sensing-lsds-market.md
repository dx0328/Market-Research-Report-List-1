<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Torque Sensing LSDs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cone-Type LSDs</li><li>Plate-Type LSDs</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Torque Sensing LSDs can be categorized into three main types: Cone-Type LSDs, Plate-Type LSDs, and Others. Cone-Type LSDs use friction cones to transfer torque to the wheel with the most traction, providing smooth and gradual locking. Plate-Type LSDs utilize preloaded spring packs and pressure rings to limit wheel spin and improve traction. The category of Others includes various LSD designs that do not fit into the cone or plate types, such as viscous coupling LSDs or electronically-controlled LSDs. Each type offers unique benefits and performance characteristics for different driving conditions.</p></p>
