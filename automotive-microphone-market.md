<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Microphone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ECM Microphone</li><li>MEMS Microphone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive microphone market includes two main types: ECM (Electret Condenser Microphone) and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) microphones. ECM microphones use a stable electret material to generate an electrical charge when sound waves hit the microphone diaphragm. On the other hand, MEMS microphones utilize tiny mechanical structures to detect sound waves and convert them into electrical signals. Both types offer high-quality audio performance and are commonly used in automotive voice control systems, hands-free calling, and driver assistance features.</p></p>
