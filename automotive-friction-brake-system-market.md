<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Friction Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive friction brake system market consists of two main types: disc brake and drum brake. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor, generating friction and causing the vehicle to slow down or stop. They are commonly found in modern vehicles and offer better performance and heat dissipation. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoes that push against the inside of a drum, creating friction to slow down the vehicle. They are typically found in older vehicles and are generally less efficient and prone to overheating compared to disc brakes.</p></p>
