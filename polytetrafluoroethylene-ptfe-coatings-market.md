<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder Coating</li><li>Liquid Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coatings are commonly used in two main forms - powder coating and liquid coating. Powder coating involves spraying a dry powder onto a surface which is then baked to form a smooth, durable finish. Liquid coating, on the other hand, involves applying a wet paint-like substance onto the surface before it is cured through heating or chemical reactions. Both forms of PTFE coatings offer excellent non-stick properties, chemical resistance, and durability, making them ideal for a wide range of industrial applications.</p></p>
