<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiator Thermostats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angled</li><li>Straight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiator thermostats come in two main types: angled and straight. Angled radiator thermostats are designed to fit into tight spaces where the radiator valve is positioned at an angle. They are often used in rooms where space is limited, such as kitchens or bathrooms. On the other hand, straight radiator thermostats are more commonly used in standard rooms where the valve is positioned vertically. Both types of radiator thermostats help regulate the temperature of a room by controlling the flow of hot water into the radiator.</p></p>
