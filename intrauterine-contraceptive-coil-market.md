<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrauterine Contraceptive Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hormonal Intrauterine Device</li><li>Copper Intrauterine Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intrauterine contraceptive coil market includes two main types: hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) and copper IUDs. Hormonal IUDs release a small amount of progestin hormone, which thickens cervical mucus, inhibits ovulation, and thins the uterine lining, making it less receptive to implantation. Copper IUDs, on the other hand, contain copper wire that produces an inflammatory reaction in the uterus, preventing fertilization. Both types of IUDs are inserted into the uterus by a healthcare professional and provide highly effective long-term contraception.</p></p>
