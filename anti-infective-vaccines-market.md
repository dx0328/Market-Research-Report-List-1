<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Infective Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li><li>Conjugate Vaccines</li><li>Live/attenuated Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-Infective Vaccines market consists of different types of vaccines used to prevent infection. Inactivated vaccines are made by killing the pathogen, while Conjugate vaccines combine a weak bacterial component with a strong antigen. Live/attenuated vaccines contain a weakened form of the pathogen. These vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies, providing long-lasting protection against infections. Inactivated vaccines are more stable but require boosters. Conjugate vaccines are effective against bacterial infections. Live/attenuated vaccines closely mimic natural infections, providing a stronger and longer-lasting immune response.</p></p>
