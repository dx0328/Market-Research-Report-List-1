<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual-clutch Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Clutch</li><li>Wet Clutch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual-clutch transmissions are available in two primary types - dry clutch and wet clutch. In dry clutch systems, the clutch is located outside of the transmission housing and operates without being submerged in oil. This design results in faster gear shifts but may lead to more wear and tear on the clutch components. Wet clutch systems, on the other hand, have the clutch immersed in oil, providing better cooling and lubrication for smoother operation and increased longevity.</p></p>
