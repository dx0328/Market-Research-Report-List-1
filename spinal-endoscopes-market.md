<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Endoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Far Lateral or Horizontal</li><li>Posterior or Interlaminar</li><li>Posterolateral or Transforaminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal endoscopes are used in minimally invasive spinal surgeries for visualization and treatment. There are three main types of spinal endoscope markets: far lateral or horizontal, posterior or interlaminar, and posterolateral or transforaminal. Far lateral or horizontal endoscopes are inserted from the side of the patient, allowing access to the spinal canal. Posterior or interlaminar endoscopes are inserted through the back of the patient, between the vertebrae, to reach the affected area. Posterolateral or transforaminal endoscopes are inserted through the patient's flank or from the posterior side, providing a diagonal approach to the spinal canal.</p></p>
