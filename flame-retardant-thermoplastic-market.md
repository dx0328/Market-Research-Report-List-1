<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame-Retardant Thermoplastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amorphous Ploymers</li><li>Crystalline Ploymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame-retardant thermoplastic materials can be divided into two main types: amorphous polymers and crystalline polymers. Amorphous polymers are characterized by their random molecular structure, which gives them better transparency and impact resistance compared to crystalline polymers. Crystalline polymers, on the other hand, have a more ordered molecular structure, leading to higher strength and stiffness. Both types of materials can be engineered with flame retardant additives to improve their fire resistance properties, making them valuable in industries where safety is a top priority.</p></p>
