<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metallic brake pads market comprises of two types - semi-metallic brake pads and low metallic NAO (Non-Asbestos Organic) brake pads. Semi-metallic brake pads are made by combining metal fibers, including copper and steel, with organic materials. These pads provide excellent stopping power and heat dissipation but may generate more noise and brake dust. On the other hand, low metallic NAO brake pads contain a lower percentage of metal fibers and are designed for vehicles that require less aggressive braking. They offer quieter operation, less dust, and lower rotor wear.</p></p>
