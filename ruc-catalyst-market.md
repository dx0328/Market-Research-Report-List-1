<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ru/C Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst</li><li>Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ru/C Catalyst Market Types can be classified into Non-Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst and Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst. Non-Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst refers to catalysts where ruthenium and carbon are not evenly distributed, resulting in varying catalytic activity across the material. On the other hand, Homogeneous Ru/C Catalyst involves a uniform distribution of ruthenium and carbon, leading to consistent catalytic performance throughout the catalyst. Both types have their own advantages and applications based on their specific characteristics and properties.</p></p>
